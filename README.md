# from-image-to-image-with-QPSK
In this program we want to transform a 40*40 PNG image into a reformed image with QPSK technique.

The progress is:
        image to Bit stream -> QPSK Modulation -> Channel(add Gauschen noise:awgn) -> QPSK Demodulation -> from Bit stream to image
        
All the code,theory and test images are uploaded in master branch,and we have the main branch for Readme.md.
